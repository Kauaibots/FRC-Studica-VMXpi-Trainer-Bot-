# FRC-Studica-VMXpi-Trainer-Bot-
This repository contains a simple program for the FRC Studica Titan Core/VMXpi Trainer Bot.

The program as it is allows the bot to drive (drive, turn, strafe) in teleoperated mode using the FRC Driver Station.
NOTE: 
  - Joysticks must be placed in USB port 0 on the Driver Station to work with this code. 
  - Due to the differences between controllers, the code may have to be modified to be used with your joystick or controller.

This program also serves as an example/introductory program for people who are learning/still getting to know the FRC command/class system.
